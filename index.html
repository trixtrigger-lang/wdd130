        <p>Hello! My name is Paul Ethan and I am a student at Brigham Young University Idaho. I come from Kenya
            and I love visiting new places and countries. I have had a chance to travel to various countries and love
            the diverse nature of different designs done by different web designers attracting and compelling products.
            I am looking forward to creating my own with the knowledge gained.</p>
